MOST HIGH

You gave me life
You’ve breath in me and revived
You gave me light
To see Your love in my life

Pre Chorus:

And I reach out to You
And lift Your name on high

I come to You
And You are for me
As a living sacrifice, my everything
I come to You
And You are for me
You are most high
You are most high
For me 

Verse II:
You’re the Living One
You are the Only One
Your love makes us one
We worship You Jesus
