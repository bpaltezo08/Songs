CHILD OF PROMISE
	

In the dark and cold night
Through the silence of the wind and might
You are born into this world
For a great purpose
For our soul

You are a mystery
With full of grace and mercy
Angels sang the glimpse of Your glory
You are King of kings
You are our Lord Most High

You are a Child of promise
The Child of heaven and earth
The Beloved of our Father, The only one
You are Love of the earth
You are the Savior of this world
